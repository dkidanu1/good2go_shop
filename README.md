## About the Site: 

The Good2Go site has been designed in the scope of the Code Institute Full Stack Frameworks with Django Project to give users a seamless way to view, select, and order meals and produce at a discounted rate. All the items present on the site have been saved from disposal. The user will have limited access to the site without registering an account, but will have full view of the meal and produce items. The idea of the site is to make all the content relevant to sustainability, easy accessibility and great experience. 

## Strategy Plane

The GoodtoGo site is an ecommerce platform created to showcase knowledge gained throughout the Full Stack course. The project aims to provide an exciting user experience for those interested in ordering meals that have been rescued. Users can successfully purchase items, and have them delivered to their home. For more user interaction a blog was created and a review section was added. Users are encouraged to reach out to GoodtoGo through a contact form. The site was inspired by the UK company Too Good Too Go.
